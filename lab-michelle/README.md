# Lab 3

## Description
This lab assignment asked us to create three files containing some text and asked us to console.log the first 8 bytes of each text file in hex. Then we created tests to guarantee that files were logged in proper order and that improper file paths would not work.

## Documentation
Done is a callback function that signals that your test has completed.
